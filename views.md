## VIEWS
* Is a stored query.
* Can be accessed as a virtual table in Postgres.
* Represents data of one or more tables through a SELECT statement.
* Does not store data physically.
* A view masks a query behind a virtual table.

#### Advantages
* A consistent interface to the data.
    * Even if tables behind it change.
* Can mask the details of the tables.
* Queries against views can reduce complexity.
    * Because you can query a view.
* Can improve security by giving selective access to data.
    * Grant access to users through a view that has specific data that users are authorized to see.

### View skeleton
```
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] [ TEMP | TEMPORARY ] VIEW name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ]
    [ WITH ( view_option_name [= view_option_value] [, ... ] ) ]
    AS query
```
* First, define view name after CREATE keyword.
* Second, define a query after AS keyword.

### Example
```
CREATE VIEW comedies AS
SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE kind = 'Comedy';
```
* A view consisting of all comedy films.

## PRACTICE PROBLEMS

<b>Practice problem 1 - tables </b>
```
CREATE TABLE People (
	PID SERIAL, 
	pName VARCHAR(50),
	pGender CHAR(1),
	pHeight FLOAT,
	PRIMARY KEY (PID)
);

CREATE TABLE Accounts (
    AID SERIAL, 
    PID INT,
    aDate DATE,
    aBalance INT,
    aOver INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (AID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PID) REFERENCES People(PID)
);

CREATE TABLE AccountRecords (
    RID SERIAL,
    AID INT,
    rDate DATE,
    rType CHAR(1),
    rAmount INT,
    rBalance INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (RID),
    FOREIGN KEY (AID) REFERENCES Accounts(AID)
);
```
<b> 1. Create a view to combine the information from the People and AccountRecords tables. Use this view to select all records for a particular individual, ordered by AID and RID.. </b>

```
CREATE VIEW peopleRecords(PID, pName, pGender, pHeight, AID, RID, rData, rType, rAmount, rBalance)
AS
SELECT
    P.PID, P.pName, P.pGender, P.pHeight,
    R.AID, R.RID, R.rDate, R.rType, R.rAmound, R.rBalance
FROM People P
    JOIN Accounts A ON P.PID = A.PID
    JOIN AccountRecords R ON R.AID = A.AID;
```
```
SELECT PR.*
FROM peopleRecords PR
WHERE PR.PID = 'Jon Jonsson'
ORDER BY PR.AID, PR.RID;
```

<b> Practice problem 2 - tables </b>
```
CREATE TABLE Agents (
    AgentID serial PRIMARY KEY,
    codename varchar(255),
    designation char(4),
    killLicense boolean NOT NULL,

    secretIdentity int,
    GenderID int,
    FOREIGN KEY (secretIdentity) REFERENCES People (PersonID),
    FOREIGN KEY (GenderID) REFERENCES Genders (GenderID)

CREATE TABLE Cases (
    CaseID serial PRIMARY KEY,
    title varchar(255),
    isClosed boolean NOT NULL,
    year smallint,
    AgentID int NOT NULL REFERENCES Agents (AgentID),
    LocationID int REFERENCES Locations (LocationID)
);

CREATE TABLE Locations (
    LocationID serial PRIMARY KEY,
    location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    caseCount int NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

<b> 2. Create a view that finds the codename and status of each agent along with the number of cases that they have led, as well as the most common location that they have led cases in. In case of a tie, display all the locations as an array. </b>
